# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Plan on improving the project

Some improvements I would love to work on is the menu section. I want to add more css styles and user interacivty to the menu to draw in potential customers (i.e. when hovering the menu items, a picture of the item appears.)
